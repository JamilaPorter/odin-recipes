        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 gallon (1.9 L) kombucha from a first fermentation.</li>
            <li>1/2 cup halved strawberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Puree: Use a handheld immersion blender or countertop blender to puree strawberries until smooth (adding a splash of kombucha if needed to get things moving).</li>
        <li>Bottle: Transfer kombucha into <a ref="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=swing+top+bottles&crid=2J5TPFDF46Q2N&sprefix=swintop+bottles%2Caps%2C114&ref=nb_sb_noss">fermentation bottles</a>, leaving about 3 inches empty at the top. Evenly distribute strawberry puree into each bottle. Seal tightly.</li>
        <li>Ferment: Place in a dark, room temperature area for 3 to 10 days, until it reaches the carbonation level you like. This process will go faster in warmer climates, and slower in cooler climates. (Tip: In order to ensure too much pressure doesn't build in the bottles, open them once a day before tightly sealing them again.)</li>
        <li>Enjoy: Strain the kombucha to remove debris (optional), then chill in the fridge before serving. Can be stored in the fridge, tightly sealed, for several weeks.</li>
        </ol>
